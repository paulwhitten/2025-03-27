Outline 

Two diverse applications  will illustrate using two application.

Results and methods

Hardware Circuit Trojan Detection Results

-----------------------------

Problem 

NN cannot explain how they inference
remove mention of weights.



Remove first and last column of the 
concept map

Need years on papers

================

AI taxonomy color the left leg.

================

AI taxonomy Architectures and Algorithms

====================


Color areas for focus of the work


===========================

FF NN

Add:  gives an inference but not explainble

================================

Gives good resuts but does not explain.

======================================

Add years to slides in paren

================================

Slide for ChatGPT

Chat GPT does not explain inference of ANN

How to distinguish

=================================

Confusion matrix get rid of the Pearson example

Groups of father and sons related.

Relationship of son taking the father's vocation.
High likelihood

=====================================


Metrics sensitive to imabnle of training set


Right hand col is insenstive to imbalance.

===================================

Move AUC to Results


=================================

Handwroting first

move trojan stuff together


=======================


Add an abstract version of the architecture earlier


=======================================


Motivation for equation on neighbors

Weigh of neighbors

Spell out correspndence


===========================

Remove the slide with 3 case based steps

Remove the "Implement Case Based" from imp routine

Make the color consistent to box

==================================

put explanation routine after case-based exp arch

===========================================


move the PBE data rationale to two slides


============================================

Trojan 

Get rid of max

Characterioze dataset

MNIST Dens Balanced

very imbalance

Five features instead of Data Shape

=================================

MNIST 

image dataset

balanced data lots of features

============================


Need to put imbalance in the conclusion

Explainability factor should be in conclusions

========================

Conclusion should say case-based outperfromed property

in both MNIST and 

Questions

We successfully addressed these with evidence in links.

In conclusion 4 papers published.

=========================

Delete ANN model slide 

Kill activation functions

Get rid of resnet slide

No SVM

Put the AI Growth in the thesis but rmove from the presentation

Kill CIA Impact model



========================================
